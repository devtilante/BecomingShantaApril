It’s not just about the physical movements of it, it’s also about finding mental peace and emotional balance through the movements. Each session has given me more than just a physical release - it’s a very grounding experience that helps me feel connected to my mind, body, and spirit. I’m feeling more aligned and at peace with myself than I have ever felt before. This holistic therapy approach has truly made a huge difference to my life."</p>

The tarot session really helped me gain clarity about some tough life decisions I had been struggling with, and the space was so cosy and comfortable! After the readings, I feel so much more grounded and looking forward for my future. The entire session was truly empowering."</p>

We are definelty a healthier family now and all of us have learnt how to care for each other holistically ( a new word we learnt at therapy).

We were definelty spectical, especially my partner who is not great with trusting. But within just the first 3 sessions, Shanta’s Relationship Wellbeing sessions helped my partner and I rediscover our connection. The therapy sessions focused on understanding each other’s needs and learning how to support one another in a healthy, loving way. We learnt  new ways to communicate with each other and  how to address challenges with empathy and compassion. We’ve never been more connected, and we owe it all to Divya at Shanta."</p>
